      <p class="text-muted">St. Xavier's School is no exception to this. But who is St. Xavier? We know that he was a holy man and has been proclaimed a saint and an example to follow. Perhaps we know vaguely that ha was a Jesuit Father, for so many Jesuit institutions are called “St. Xavier’s”. Perhaps also we think that he was the founder of the Jesuit Order,-which he was not, – and that he had some connection with India, which he certainly had.</p>

      <p>A good science project for an interschool competition could be a research project on a current scientific topic, such as:

        Investigating the effects of pollution on a local ecosystem
        Examining the properties and uses of a new material or technology
        Analyzing the genetic makeup of a particular species or organism
        Studying the impact of climate change on a specific region or population
        It's important to choose a topic that you're passionate about and that can be researched in the time you have available. You should also consider the resources available to you, such as access to equipment or research facilities. It's also important to make sure that your project is original and not a copy of someone else's work.
